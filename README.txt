Solar Optimization Simulator
Created by Mark Capka, Sean Zahller, Anthony Hirt, and Josh Canton
EWU Senior Project 2022 Winter Quarter

Program is meant to show the user details of how sunlight will affect a house at a certain location and time.
Returns details on sunlight intensity, sunrise/sunset times, and solar panel information.
Able to manipulate position of objects and manipulate time of day between sunrise and sunset.

Original Setup:
JavaFX, Maven, IntelliJ IDE.

Before Installation:
1)Make sure all of the following are updated to the newest versions:
	-JDK and SDK for JavaFX
	-IntelliJ
2)Know where your workspace folder for intelliJ is located

To install and run:
1)Download zip and extract into IntelliJ workspace folder
2)Open IntelliJ, choose "Open project", Locate and select extracted folder as project root, Press OK
3)Load maven project, should be a pop asking to load maven project select yes
3)Go to "File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Depencies"
4)Click the "+" and locate sun1.jar in the Resources folder of the project, Press OK
5)Repeat step 4 for jim3dsModelImporterJFX.jar
6)Press Apply, And then press OK
7)Copy all resource files besides the jar files(All 3ds files, and PNG/JPEG), Paste them to your C: folder
OR
7)CTRL+F, search for C:, change code of file location to its path on your system within the resources folder
8)Edit run configurations -> New Application
9)Change the name to SkyBoxApplication, Change JAVA SDK to atleast 17, Choose main in project: SkyBoxApplication.java
10)Click Apply, Click OK.

Troubleshooting Steps:
With step 9)Choose working directory: Select project folder "Solar Optimization"
With step 3)"File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Sources". If source, resources, and target files not specified:
src/main/java = source folder
src/main/resources = resources folder
target = target folder

Program should now run, If not restart and look for load maven project tip, and redo any steps necessary.

UPDATE/To Work On:
*SkyBox needs better folding
*Error checking on sunrise/sunset times
*Refactor into neater code/seperate classes
*Change military time to digital time
*UI Tweaks: Button spacing, fonts, size, etc.
*Moving roof solar panels
*Individually add/remove ground or roof solar panel
